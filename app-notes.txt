This app is designed to assist in tracking deliveries and pickups. 

The idea was inspired by the need for a tracking system at the company I currently work for(Campbell Tractor). Though it will be created specifically for that purpose, it could be used for more applications in the future.

Features:

-ability to add customer details through form input(name, address, phone, mowerModels[array], mowerPicture, openJobs)
-utilize gps and maps to guide user to destinations
-sort destinations by distance
-button to text customers to notify when leaving(if customer is open to text, otherwise call)
-when using app, enter job number to start
-set job numbers to track, select pickup or delivery
